### 1 - Implementation of Kalman filter in Jupyter Pynotebook
### 2 - Code comparing performance of path finding algorithms with different heuristics:
    (in cases including and excluding diagonal movement)
    1) Dijkstra
    2) Admissible heuristic
    3) Non admissible heuristic
    4) Diagonal distance as heuristic
    5) Manhattan distance as heuristic
    6) Euclidean distance
